1: This example uses an application protocol that implements a basic search feature. 
    The client sends a search request and the server does a lookup for a match. If the request sent by 
    the client isn¡¯t recognized as a search, the server assumes it¡¯s a binary request and returns a 
    binary response.


2: The server¡¯s Message class works in essentially the same way as the client¡¯s and vice-versa. 
    The difference is that the client initiates the connection and sends a request message, followed by
    processing the server¡¯s response message. Conversely, the server waits for a connection, processes 
    the client¡¯s request message, and then sends a response message.
